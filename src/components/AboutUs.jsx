      description="An excellent, yeast-risen English muffin bread that has the familiar nooks and crannies just like its smaller muffin cousin, but is much simpler to make because it needs no kneading and requires only one rising. The crusty bread has a soft, pleasantly toothsome texture that goes well with most meals, makes a great sandwich...and of course, makes terrific toast! From start to finish, this homemade bread is ready to eat in less than 90 minutes"
